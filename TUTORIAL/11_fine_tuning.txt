Number of hidden layers:
	1 hidden layer gets reasonable results
	1 hidden layer with enough neurons can model the most complex functions
	deeper networks need less neurons, making them faster to train
	ramp up the number of hidden layers until you start overfitting training set

Number of neurons per hidden layer:
	form a funnel, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer
	OR same number for each layer and ramp up the number until overfitting
	pick a model with more layers and neurons then you need, then use early
		stopping to prevent overfitting (and regularization techniques = dropout)

Activation functions:
	ReLU in the hidden layers: faster to compute
	Output layer: softmax for classification, no function for regression.
